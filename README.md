## I'm MR-E-64 (aka Ewan)

### What i'm about:
This is the beginning of my new adventure, hopefully, trying to understand and learn a small part of the coding world!

I am coming from a career spent as a Image Retoucher using Photoshop and I am hopping I will be able to integrate some parts of what I learn back into that profession.

You can find some of my learning to code projects on my _code pen_ site here ` https://codepen.io/mr-e-64 `

 Regards, MR-E-64
