## Welcome to my GitHub Pages Page!

This is the beginning of my new adventure, hopefully, trying to understand and learn a small part of the coding world!

I am coming from a career spent as a Image Retoucher using Photoshop and I am hopping I will be able to integrate some parts of what I learn back into that profession.
